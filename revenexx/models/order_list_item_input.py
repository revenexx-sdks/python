    Attributes
    ----------
    category_slug : Optional[str]
        The catalogue category the article sat in when the position was saved, as a slug. Kept so a long list can be grouped the way the shop groups it without a call to the catalogue.
    cost_center_id : Optional[str]
        The cost centre this position books to, as the tenant&#039;s ERP names it. Free text and not our enum. It survives into the ORDER position, which has a `cost_center` column; a CART line has none, so the cart conversion carries it in the line snapshot instead.
    custom_sku : Optional[str]
        The buyer&#039;s OWN article number for this article — what their purchasing system calls it, which is rarely what the shop calls it. Free text, and the field a B2B buyer searches their own lists by.
    image : Optional[str]
        The article image at the time the position was saved, as a URL or a path — a snapshot like `name`, and nothing here refreshes it. It rides into the cart line and the order position in their snapshot, because neither has a column for it.
    metadata : Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        Free-form data the tenant keeps on the position. Never read by this app; it travels into the cart line / order position snapshot untouched. A write replaces the whole document rather than merging into it.
    name : str
        The article name AS IT WAS when the position was saved. A snapshot on purpose: the list is the buyer&#039;s own record, so a renamed or withdrawn article still reads the way they wrote it down.
    position : Optional[float]
        Sort order within the list, ascending — the order the positions collection returns by default and the order the conversions hand the lines over in. Neither dense nor unique: an add with no `position` of its own takes the list&#039;s current position COUNT, so removing a position from the middle and adding another leaves two rows sharing a number. A bulk replace assigns the array index the same way, so it renumbers only the positions it is not given explicitly.
    position_texts : Optional[List[Any]]
        Per-position notes the buyer wrote — an engraving, a delivery instruction, a reference for the picker. An ARRAY OF STRINGS, one entry per line; the order conversion joins them with newlines into the order position&#039;s single `position_text`, and the cart conversion carries the array in the line snapshot.
    price : Optional[float]
        Unit price snapshot — what the buyer saw when they saved the position, in whatever way the catalogue quoted it. It is a record, not a live price: the cart and the order reprice on their own terms, so this never becomes what somebody is charged.
    product_id : Optional[str]
        The catalogue product this position stands for. One of `product_id` / `sku` must be set (the database enforces it); this is the identity the products app answers to, and the one `reject_unknown_articles` and the conversions check against.
    quantity : Optional[float]
        How much of the article the list holds. Greater than zero — the database refuses the rest — and fractional to three decimals, because a B2B position may be 2.5 metres or 0.75 kilos.
    sku : Optional[str]
        The article number as the catalogue knows it — the alternative identity to `product_id`, and the one an ERP integration usually joins on.
    subcategory_slug : Optional[str]
        The catalogue subcategory, as a slug. Same purpose as `category_slug`, one level down.
    tax_rate : Optional[float]
        The VAT rate that applied when the position was saved, as a PERCENT (19 = 19 %). Four decimals so a rate like 8.25 % survives; carts and orders document the same field the same way, and the conversion forwards the number unchanged.
    unit : Optional[str]
        The unit `quantity` counts in, in the tenant&#039;s own words. Deliberately open text and deliberately NOT a vocabulary: a B2B catalogue units in pieces, metres, kilos, rolls and pallets, and any closed list published here would be a guess.
