    """
    What was built. `copied` and `seeded` account for every child row that now exists, and `readiness` is the verdict on the result — so the call that made the market also tells you whether it finished the job.

    Attributes
    ----------
    copied : Optional[MarketCloneCopied]
        Child rows copied from the source, per collection. A flag left false is a zero here, and so is a source that had none of that kind.
    market : Optional[Market]
        A distinct business context within a tenant — a country, a region, or a storefront segment such as B2C vs B2B — with its own base currency, locales, traded currencies and tax classes. A market is also the platform&#039;s `market` SCOPE dimension: every other commerce app slices its data by one, keyed on this row&#039;s `code`. A market is never just this row: it needs at least one locale, one currency and one tax class before it can serve, which is what /readiness measures and what /clone and /backfill build.
    readiness : Optional[MarketReadiness]
        Can this market actually trade? `ready` is false only when a BLOCKING check failed — no currency to quote in, no tax class to tax with. Warnings are degraded-but-serviceable.
    seeded : Optional[MarketCloneSeeded]
        Rows this call added that were copied from nowhere, because the new market would otherwise have been left unable to trade: the tenant `fallback_locale` when neither market had a locale, and the base currency when it is not in the copied set. Zero on both is the normal, healthy answer — it means nothing had to be invented.
    source : Optional[MarketRef]
        The market that was read from, resolved — so a caller who passed a code back gets the uuid, and one who passed a uuid gets the code the rest of the platform stores.
